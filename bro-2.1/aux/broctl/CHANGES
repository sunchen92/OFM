1.1 | 2012-08-24 15:09:04 -0700

  * Fix MailAlarmsTo broctl config option. Addresses #814. (Daniel
    Thayer)

  * Fix configure script to exit with non-zero status on error. (Jon
    Siwek)

1.1-beta-2 | 2012-08-10 12:29:56 -0700

  * Updates to disable STDERR printing from the reporter framework.
    (Seth Hall)

1.1-beta | 2012-07-20 07:03:21 -0700

  * Fix broctl startup when using custom config file dirs. (Jon Siwek)

  * Change crash report info to include stack traces from all threads.
    (Jon Siwek)

  * Changed the invocation of gdb that produces the crash report. (Jon
    Siwek)

1.0-64 | 2012-07-10 16:07:50 -0700

  * Remove automatic override of config file directory with /usr prefix.

  * Small updates to BroControl docs. (Daniel Thayer)

1.0-58 | 2012-07-02 15:55:06 -0700

  * Improvements to built-in load-balancing support. Instead of adding
    a separate worker entry in node.cfg for each Bro worker process on
    each worker host, it is now possible to just specify the number of
    worker processes on each host. (Daniel Thayer)

    This change adds three new keywords to the node.cfg file (to be
    used with worker entries): lb_procs (specifies number of workers
    on a host), lb_method (specifies what type of load balancing to
    use: pf_ring, myricom, or interfaces), and lb_interfaces (used
    only with "lb_method=interfaces" to specify which interfaces to
    load-balance on).

    Two new broctl plugins (which operate automatically and the user
    doesn't need to be aware of them) are added to set the appropriate
    environment variables when either PF_RING or myricom
    load-balancing is being used.

1.0-43 | 2012-07-02 15:40:01 -0700

  * Improve README. Rewrote the section on site-specific customization
    so that it is more clear about the load order of scripts relevant
    to site-specific customization.  Removed the description of
    several features that don't seem to work: "worker-1.local.bro" is
    not automatically loaded, there is no example policy in
    local-manager.bro, local-manager.bro and local-worker.bro do not
    automatically load local.bro, and proxies do not automatically
    load local-worker.bro. (Daniel Thayer)

1.0-40 | 2012-06-06 11:52:06 -0700

    * Fix the "cron disable" command, which didn't work. This also
      removes the config option CronEnabled. The command is now the
      only way to turn off cron operation. (Daniel Thayer)

1.0-38 | 2012-05-24 17:42:37 -0700

  * Improvements to IPv6 support. (Jon Siwek)

    - Add ability to manage a cluster over non-global IPv6 scope (e.g.
      link-local), by specifying "zone_id" keys per node in node.cfg
      and "ZoneID" option in broctl.cfg.

    - Replace socket.gethostbyname lookups with socket.getaddrinfo to
      support IPv6.

    - ::1 is now recognized as the IPv6 loopback and a "local" address
      where before 127.0.0.1 was expected.

    - Update usages of ping, ssh, rsync, and ifconfig to work with IPv6
      addresses.

    - New "IPv6Comm" option in broctl.cfg can be set to 0 to turn off
      IPv6-based communication capabilities (on by default).

1.0-35 | 2012-05-17 11:57:30 -0700

  * BroControl tweaks to support non-ASCII logs. (Robin)

        - The main change is that we give another argument to
          post-processors that indicates the writer type that produced
          the log. That comes with an incompatible part: the
          make-archive-name script now receives the writer as its
          2nd(!) argument. Customized versions need be adapted.

        - The standard postprocessors now check whether they are
          processing something else than ASCII logs and adapt their
          behaviour accordingly (e.g., by not compressing, and or not
          running trace-summary).

1.0-32 | 2012-05-14 17:20:17 -0700

  * Fix typos in broctl docs. (Daniel Thayer)

1.0-29 | 2012-05-03 11:34:29 -0700

  * Added an option to specify 'etc' directory. Addresses #801.
    (Daniel Thayer)

  * Fix typos. (Daniel Thayer)

1.0-24 | 2012-04-24 14:37:49 -0700

  * Update some broctl option descriptions. (Daniel Thayer)

1.0-22 | 2012-04-19 09:52:44 -0700

  * Options SitePolicyStandalone, SitePolicyManager, and
    SitePolicyWorker were unused. Now they are, and they replace the
    hard-coded defaults if defined. Addresses #797. (Daniel Thayer)

1.0-20 | 2012-04-19 09:08:32 -0700

  * Remove unused broctl options and fixed a couple of typos in the
    option names. (Daniel Thayer)

1.0-17 | 2012-04-16 18:06:28 -0700

  * Fixed lots of documentation typos and broken links. (Daniel
    Thayer)

  * Update broctl help information. (Daniel Thayer)
    

1.0-13 | 2012-04-09 15:59:17 -0700

  * Remove "-p" option from broctl "scripts" command help. (Daniel
    Thayer)

  * Updating helper script to work with conn.log in Bro 2.0. (Daniel
    Thayer)


1.0-9 | 2012-03-28 15:46:02 -0700

0.5-beta-43 | 2012-01-03 14:45:40 -0800

  * broctl now creates spool directories it finds missing. Addresses
    #716. (Edward Groenendaal)

0.5-beta-39 | 2011-12-16 02:49:28 -0800

  * Add StopTimeout option to broctl.cfg that sets the number of
    seconds to wait after issuing the 'stop' command before sending a
    SIGKILL to Bro instances. Adresses #608. (Jon Siwek)

  * Add CommTimeout option to broctl.cfg that sets the number of
    seconds to timeout Broccoli connnections. Addresses #608. (Jon
    Siwek)

  * Re-order the way local.bro and local-<node>.bro scripts are
    loaded. Node-specific local scripts now load after local.bro so
    tha identifiers defined by the loading of local.bro can be used in
    them. Addresses #663 (Jon Siwek)

0.5-beta-34 | 2011-12-02 17:17:14 -0800

  * Make BroControl more robust when a node dies. (Robin Sommer)

  * Disable collecting of prof.logs. The logs can get huge, which lets
    cron take a while. (Robin Sommer)

  * Fix standalone->cluster upgrade failing to update logs/current
    symlink. Fixes #676. (Jon Siwek)

  * Fix broctl 'scripts' command in cluster mode. Fixes #655. (Jon

  * Fixing some platforms behaving poorly during configure-time checks
    when a superproject's languages didn't encompass a subproject's.
    (Jon Siwek)

  * Configure sendmail option in options.py instead of broctl.cfg.
    Fixed #645. (Jon Siwek)

  * Fix extraneous installation of BroControl plugins. (Jon Siwek)
    
  * Apply patch for BroControl Python 2.3/2.4 compatibility. Closes
    #662. (William Jones)

    broctl. (Justin Azoff)

0.5-beta-12 | 2011-11-06 19:23:43 -0800

  * broctl.cfg now determines sendmail location at configure-time.  
    Addreses #645 (Jon Siwek)

  * Disable log expiration by default. Addresses #613. (Jon Siwek)
    
  * Make symlink to broctl-config.sh update with `broctl install`.
    Addresses #648 (Jon Siwek)

  * Fixed a problem when host= in standalone is not 127.0.0.1 or
    localhost. (Seth Hall)

  * Updating CHANGES and VERSION. (Robin Sommer)

  * Make dist now cleans the copied source. (Jon Siwek)

0.41-130 | 2011-10-18 08:03:35 -0700

  * Distribution cleanup and some README fixes. (Robin Sommer)

  * Fixed a bug caused by communication framework API update. Reported
    by Daniel. (Seth Hall)

0.41-128 | 2011-10-06 17:23:03 -0700

  * Change broctl.cfg LogRotationInterval to be specificed in seconds. (Jon Siwek)

  * Force broctl 'process' command to enable local logging. Addresses
    #632 (Jon Siwek)

0.41-124 | 2011-10-05 16:58:10 -0700

   * New broctl.cfg option for log rotation interval. Addresses #630.
     (Jon Siwek)

   * Removed some of the broct/nodes/* scripts and instead
     consolidated their functionality into the node-specific scripts
     that come with Bro's cluster framework. (Jon Siwek)

   * Within the cluster framework, local-<node>.bro scripts should now
     be loaded after the distributions <node>.bro script so things can
     be overrided. (Jon Siwek)

   * Auto-generated broctl scripts are loaded after all node-specific
     scripts and can override their options. (Jon Siwek)

  * Move configuration of PFRINGClusterID from broctl.cfg.in to
    options.py. Addresses #621. (Jon Siwek)

  * Add configure-time check for libpcap PF_RING support. Addresses
    #621 (Jon Siwek)

  * Fixing typo with process command. (Robin Sommer)

  * Script cleanup.  (Seth Hall)

    - Reshuffling "check" functionality into check.bro.

    - Removing some code to deal with the non-existent react framework.

  * Give check command its own script for tuning options. Addresses
    #618). (Jon Siwek)

  * Stop and restart command now stop worker nodes first. Addresses
    #596. (Jon Siwek)

  * broctl check no longer rotates logs. Addresses #618. (Jon Siwek)

0.41-101 | 2011-09-08 02:20:28 -0400

  * Implementing PF_RING environment variables. (Seth Hall)

0.41-99 | 2011-09-04 09:08:59 -0700

  * Added --with-pcap configure option. (Jon Siwek)

  * Various smaller tweaks to CMake setup. (Jon Siwek)

  * Removed alarm log mailing postprocessing script from BroControl.
    (Jon Siwek)

  * Log rotation is disabled when using the 'process' command to
    analyze trace files. (Jon Siwek)

  * Changed the 'mail-log' postprocessor to mail alarm.log's. (Jon
    Siwek)

  * Fix Config.state key capitalization inconsistencies. (Jon Siwek)

  * Fixes for broctl 'check' command. Addresses #548. (Seth Hall and
    Jon Siwek)

  * Updated README. (Jon Siwek)

  * Copy bro binary only in NFS mode (fixes #361). (Jon Siwek)

  * Fix install command failing because of missing parent dirs. (Jon Siwek)

  * Removing the analysis.dat file since it's not used anymore. (Seth Hall)

  * Updating log rotation support for the new logging rotation code.
    (Seth Hall)

  * Updates for cleanup and meshing with Bro reorg. (Seth Hall)

0.41-73 | 2011-08-13 12:14:28 -0700

  * Moving README*. into subdir doc. The top-level README is now
    auto-generated. (Robin Sommer)

0.41-68 | 2011-08-05 12:49:30 -0700

  * Install example config files dynamically when the distribution
    version differs from existing version on disk. (Jon Siwek)

0.41-63 | 2011-08-03 22:10:40 -0700

  * Revamped how the work is split between Bro and BroControl. Much of
    functionality previously found in BroControl policy scripts has
    moved over to Bro. (Seth Hall)

  * Adapted BroControl to Bro 2.0 policy scripts.

  * A new plugin interface allows external Python code to hook into
    BroControl processing. See README for more information. (Robin
    Sommer)

    Two example plugins are shipped: (1) "ps.bro" shows all Bro
    processes currently running on any cluster node, even if not
    managed by BroControl; (2) "TestPlugin" is a demo plugin
    demonstrating all the functionality a plugin can use (but doesn't
    do anything sensible with it).

  * A new offline mode for processing a trace. The new command
    "process <trace>" runs Bro offline on the given trace, using the
    current BroControl configuration. One can optionally give give
    further Bro command line options and scripts. In cluster mode the
    the Bro process loads both manager and worker configurations
    simultaniously.

    Addresses #273. (Robin Sommer)

  * Removed the "analysis" command. (Seth Hall)

  * Installation does no longer differentiate between standalone and
    cluster mode. node.cfg now fully controls this. (Seth Hall)

  * Tons of little fixes, improvements, and polishing (Seth Hall, Jon
    Siwek, and Robin Sommer)

0.41-9 | 2011-06-01 11:35:36 -0700

  * Standardize shell script hashbang on install. (Jon Siwek)

  * Fix binary package broctl-config.sh symlink installation
    regression. (Jon Siwek)

  * Changes to allow DEB packaging via CPack, addresses #458. (Jon Siwek)

  * Fixed a problem with the "update" command, which could delete data
    from many global state tables unintentionally. (Seth Hall)

0.41-2 | 2011-05-02 11:29:07 -0700

  * Symlink install scripted at install time for CMake 2.6
    compatibility. (Jon Siwek)

0.41 | 2011-04-07 21:14:53 -0700

  * Tweaks to the documentation generation. (Robin Sommer)

  * CMake tweaks. (Jon Siwek)

  * Bugfix: trace-summary sampled in standalone mode rather than cluster
    mode. (Robin Sommer)

  * Bugfix: Creating links from the log directory to the current log files
    didn't work in standalone mode. (Robin Sommer)

0.4-19 | 2011-01-31 15:26:48 -0800

  * A new option CompressLogs (default on), indicating whether
    archived logs are to be gzipped. (Robin Sommer)

  * A lot of configure/cmake/install/package tuning. (Jon Siwek)

  * Adding /sbin and /usr/sbin to path local-interfaces script
    searches for ifconfig. Closes #293. (Robin Sommer)

  * Fixing uncaught exception in lock file handling. (Seth Hall).

  * Making cluster event specifications redefinable. (Seth Hall).

  * Fixing for pretty printing numerical values. (Seth Hall).

  * Fixing "netstats" command distinction between cluster and
    standalone mode. (Justin Azoff)

0.4-10 | 2011-01-15 14:14:05 -0800

  * Changes for CPack binary packaging (Jon Siwek)

  * Fix package configuration macro returning from sub-project too early (Jon Siwek)

  * Add warning when building and installing are done by different users (Jon Siwek)

  * Changes to broctl's "make install" process (Jon Siwek)

    - Simplify install by not compiling python code.
    - The broctl-config.sh symlink needs to be made at configure time
      and install()'ed in order for CPack packaging to correctly bundle it
    - Reverted a change in (90ddc4d) to that caused spool/ and logs/
      directories to not be installed in the case that they existed at
      configure time.

  * Fix for PackageMaker not accepting non-numeric versions (Jon Siwek)

0.4-9 | 2011-01-12 08:51:11 -0800

  * Making df portably deal with long lines in the OS's df output.
    (Robin Sommer)

0.4-8 | 2011-01-04 20:30:41 -0800

  * Changing some installation paths. "broctl install" copied a
    number of files to share/bro/*, which violates the common
    assumption that things there are static. It can also create
    permission problems if the user running "broctl install" is not
    the one installing Bro. So now the pieces copied/generated by
    "broctl install" are moved to spool/*. (Robin Sommer)

  * The CMake install does no longer recreate some of the top-level
    directories when they already exist. That makes it possible to
    now symlink them somewhere else after the first install. (Robin
    Sommer)

  * When broctl doesn't find spool/broctl.dat it no longer aborts
    but just warns. That allows CMake to skip installing an empty
    one. (Robin Sommer)

  * Deleting an unused policy file. (Robin Sommer)

  * Updating update-changes script. (Robin Sommer)

0.4-5 | 2010-12-20 14:10:25 -0800 | 768a9e550c3554de2e0bf9e3af2ae99400203046

  * New helper script for maintaing CHANGES file. (Robin Sommer)

0.4-1 | 2010-12-20 12:03:34 -0800 | a05be1242b4e06dca1bb1a38ed871e7e2d78181b

  * Fix for dealing with large vsize values reported by "top" (Craig
    Leres)

  * Fixed the top helper script to assign the command variable
    appropriately. (Seth Hall)

  * Escape commands given to CMake's execute_process (Jon Siwek)

0.4 | Fri Dec 10 01:35:36 2010 -0800 | df922e8a64a631aadb485b5044fe9ae1046d47ca

- Moving BroControl to its own git repository.

- Converting README to reST format.

- Renamed "Capstats" config option to "CapstatsPath".

- Merge with Subversion repository as of r7098. Incorporated changes:

  o Increasing default timeouts for scan detector significantly.

  o Increasing the manager's max_remote_events_processed to
    something large, as it would slow down the process too much
    otherwise and there's no other work to be interleaved with it
    anyway.

  o Adding debug output to cluster's part of catch-and-release
    (extends the debugging already present in policy/debug.bro)

  o Fixing typo in util.py. Closes #223.

  o Added note to README pointing to HTML version.

  o Disabling print_hook for proxies' remote.log.

  o broctl's capstats now reports a total as well, and stats.log
    tracks these totals. Closes #160.

  o Avoiding spurious "waiting for lock" messages in cron mode.
    Closes #206.

  o Bug fixes for installation on NFS.

  o Bug fix for top command on FreeBSD 8.

  o crash-diag now checks whether gdb is available.

  o trace-summary reports the sample factor in use in its output,
    and now also applies it to the top-local-networks output (not
    doing the latter was a bug).

  o Removed the default twice-a-day rotation for conn.log. The
    default rotation for conn.log now is now once every 24h, just
    like for all other logs with the exception of mail.log (which is
    still rotated twice a day, and thus the alarms are still mailed
    out twice a day).

  o Fixed the problem of logs sometimes being filed into the wrong
    directory (see the (now gone) FAQ entry in the README).

  o One can now customize the archive naming scheme. See the
    corresponding FAQ entry in the README.

  o Cleaned up, and extended, collection of cluster statistics.

    ${logdir}/stats now looks like this:

      drwxr-xr-x   4 bro  wheel      59392 Apr  5 17:55 .
      drwxr-xr-x  96 bro  wheel       2560 Apr  6 12:00 ..
      -rw-r--r--   1 bro  wheel        576 Apr  6 16:40 meta.dat
      drwxr-xr-x   2 bro  wheel       2048 Apr  6 16:40 profiling
      -rw-r--r--   1 bro  wheel  771834825 Apr  6 16:40 stats.log
      drwxr-xr-x   2 bro  wheel       2048 Apr  6 16:25 www

    stats.log accumulates cluster statistics collected every time
    "cron" is called.

    - profiling/ keeps the nodes' prof.logs.

    - www/ keeps a subset of stats.log in CSV format for easy plotting.

    - meta.dat contains meta information about the current cluster
    state (in particular which nodes we have, and when the last
    stats update was done).

    Note that there is not Web setup yet to actually plot the data
    in www/.

  o BroControl now automatically maintains links inside today's log
    archive directory pointing to the current live version of the
    corresponding log file (if Bro is running). For example:

    smtp.log.11:52:18-current -> /usr/local/cluster/spool/manager/smtp.log

  o Alarms mailed out by BroControl now (1) have the notice msg in the
    subject; and (2) come with the full mail.log entry in the body.
