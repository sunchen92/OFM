##! This is an example script that demonstrates documentation features.
##! Comments of the form ``##!`` are for the script summary.  The contents of
##! these comments are transferred directly into the auto-generated
##! `reStructuredText <http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html>`_
##! (reST) document's summary section.
##!
##! .. tip:: You can embed directives and roles within ``##``-stylized comments.
##!
##! There's also a custom role to reference any identifier node in
##! the Bro Sphinx domain that's good for "see alsos", e.g.
##!
##! See also: :bro:see:`Example::a_var`, :bro:see:`Example::ONE`,
##! :bro:see:`SSH::Info`
##!
##! And a custom directive does the equivalent references:
##!
##! .. bro:see:: Example::a_var Example::ONE SSH::Info

# Comments that use a single pound sign (#) are not significant to
# a script's auto-generated documentation, but ones that use a
# double pound sign (##) do matter.  In some cases, like record
# field comments, it's necessary to disambiguate the field with
# which a comment associates: e.g. "##<" can be used on the same line
# as a field to signify the comment relates to it and not the
# following field. "##<" can also be used more generally in any
# variable declarations to associate with the last-declared identifier.
#
# Generally, the auto-doc comments (##) are associated with the
# next declaration/identifier found in the script, but the doc framework
# will track/render identifiers regardless of whether they have any
# of these special comments associated with them.
#
# The first sentence contained within the "##"-stylized comments for
# a given identifier is special in that it will be used as summary
# text in a table containing all such identifiers and short summaries.
# If there are no sentences (text terminated with '.'), then everything
# in the "##"-stylized comments up until the first empty comment
# is taken as the summary text for a given identifier.

    ############## types ################

    # Note that I'm just mixing the "##" and "##<"
    # types of comments in the following declarations
    # as a demonstration.  Normally, it would be good style
    # to pick one and be consistent.
