##! A framework for establishing and controlling a cluster of Bro instances.
##! In order to use the cluster framework, a script named
##! ``cluster-layout.bro`` must exist somewhere in Bro's script search path
##! which has a cluster definition of the :bro:id:`Cluster::nodes` variable.
##! The ``CLUSTER_NODE`` environment variable or :bro:id:`Cluster::node`
##! must also be sent and the cluster framework loaded as a package like
##! ``@load base/frameworks/cluster``.

@load base/frameworks/control
